        <h1> Scallion Pancakes 葱油饼 </h1>
        <p>Scallion pancakes are one of my all-time favorite Chinese dimsum snacks. These pancakes are thin, round and savory, crispy on the outside while chewy on the inside. Here's how you can make them with just 4 simple ingredients!</p>

        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 2 cups all-purpose flour </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon salt </li>
            <li> 1/4 cup canola oil</li>
            <li> 3 to 4 scallions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li> 3/4 cup hot (just boiling) water, plus a few more tablespoons, if necessary</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="method">
            <h2> Method </h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Mix the dough: Add flour and salt to a medium bowl. Stir to combine. Add 3/4 cups of hot water to the flour and stir with a wooden spoon. Continue stirring until all the water has been absorbed by the flour. Don’t worry if the dough has not formed completely yet. </li>
                
                <li> Knead the dough: Using your hands, knead all the bits of dough together inside the bowl. If your dough is still very dry, add a splash of hot water, about 1 to 2 tablespoons, until it comes together and all the flour is absorbed. Continue kneading the dough for about 2 more minutes. The dough will feel moist but it should not stick to your hands too much.</li>

                <li> Rest the dough: Shape the dough into a round ball. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.</li>

                <li> Roll out the pancakes: Sprinkle flour on top of a work surface. Divide the dough into 4 pieces of equal size. Work with one piece at a time, leaving the remaining pieces in the bowl. Shape piece of dough into a small ball. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into a thin circle, about 7 to 8 inches in diameter.</li>

                <li> Add the scallions: Brush a thin layer of canola oil on top of the dough, making sure not to miss the edges. Sprinkle sliced scallions all over the dough.</li>

                <li> Roll and flatten the pancake: Starting on one end, roll the circle of dough into a log. Take one end of the rolled up dough and curl it toward the center, like a snail's shell. Tuck the end of the dough underneath the spiral. Use the palm of your hand to flatten the dough into a thick circle. Roll it out again with your rolling pin. Try to roll it out as thinly as possible. A few slices of scallions may pop out during the process, and that’s perfectly normal. Transfer rolled out scallion pancake to a plate. Repeat steps 4 through 6 with the remaining dough pieces.</li>

                <li>Heat about 2 teaspoons of canola oil a small nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium heat. Place one of the pancakes in the middle of the pan and pan fry each side for about 2 to 3 minutes, until they’re golden brown. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the 3 remaining scallion pancakes, adding more oil to the pan as needed.</li>

                <li>Serve the hot pancakes: Cut the scallion pancakes into small wedges and serve while hot. (The pancakes are still good when cooled, but will no longer be crispy.)</li>
            </ul>
